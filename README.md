## Development

### Dev cluster setup

A docker-compose setup is provided to quickly spin up a local Kafka cluster with pre-created topics, consumer groups,
commited offsets etc ...

```sh
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Generate data

After the local cluster is up and running, you can generate some data to work with, 
using`go run ./cmd/generate`.

### Run `ktea`

Use `go run -tags dev cmd/ktea/main.go` to run `ktea` from the root of the repository.

> Note: running the tui with dev build tag will simulate an artificial slow network by sleeping for 2 seconds when doing network IO. This way the loaders and spinners can be visually asserted.
> 

### Run tests

Because of interfering testcontainers kafka brokers the tests, for now, can't be run in parallel.
This will be fixed in the future.

```sh
go test -count=1 ./...  -p 1
```
